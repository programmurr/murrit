## Installation Instructions (Mac/Linux)

*Please not these instructions are for personal use. The Firebase Emulator Suite requires linking your Google account
to the Firebase CLI. If you install the CLI and link your account, you will be authorised to install and run your
projects but not mine.*

Follow the steps and enter the commands in your terminal.  

1. Clone the repo
    - `git clone git@github.com:programmurr/murrit.git`

2. Enter the murrit directory
    - `cd murrit`

3. Install dependencies
    - `npm install`

4. Install the Firebase CLI
    - `curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash`

5. Check if you have Java installed
    - `java -version`

6. If you do not have Java, install it with these commands
    - `sudo apt update`
    - `sudo apt install default-jre`
    - `sudo apt install default-jdk`

7. Verify installations
    - `java -version`
    - `javac -version`

8. Connect the Firebase CLI to your Google account
    - `firebase login`

9. Run the emulators
    - `firebase emulators:start`

10. Open a new terminal tab in the same directory and run the React app
    - `npm start`

A development instance of murrit should now be running in 
the browser. At the moment, data will not persist beyond emulator
shutdown. [Follow the documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure#startup) to set up test data.
